# Different Designs for Optimal Effects

Design patterns are slightly different solutions with the same structure to recurring design problems. In other words, different designs will lead to optimal effects that a developer wants. Effective design patterns will allow the developers to see issues that might not be seen until a certain point in the project. This way, developers can dodge major problems from issues that were not seen easily. 

For example, you can see a design pattern in cars. Different cars are used for different situations. In one situation, a car needs compete in a race. That specific car needs every advantage it needs to be quick, and handle turns at high speed to get around the track in as little time as possible. It would need to have a very high horse power engine to be to get to high speeds, very sticky tires to handle turns at high speed, and have aerodynamics that increases the car's friction to the road. In another situation the car is needed for general use, like going on the highway. Here, the car is used to save money on gas. The car needs to have a low horsepower engine reduce fuel consumption, tires that decrease the rolling resistance from the road, and aerodynamics that has the lowest drag. Sports cars would have similar designs to a race car, where as a passenger car would have a design similar to a gas-effective car.

# Real Life Design Patterns

When it comes to fashion, I follow a design pattern. The most noteable one that many people and myself use is wearing black pants and white shoes, or just the white shoes. This combination is one of the most tried and true combination in any outfit. Having black and white in the bottom layers of your color blocking allows for literally any color combination. The white sneakers are the most versatile color os sneakers you can wear, since it is very minimal and clean. From a casual outfit like a t-shirt and jeans, to semi-casual like chinos and a sports jacket. The strong foundation of white shoes and black pants serves as a solid foundation fo any outfit, in many occasions.

Thus, having the coding equivalent of white shoes and black pants is a very useful thing to have One of the design patterns that I have used is using the meteor-template from my ICS class. It serves as a really  good foundation for making a website since it uses Semantic UI in React, which is a very versatile and straight-forward framework for web development.

# Hands on Approach

Learning-by-doing is one of the best ways of getting used to the material that you are learning. I actually prefer to learn things by working through problems in this class. The more problems I do, the more comfortable I feel with doing the material. However, there are some caveats such as learning jargon and conceptial ideas. It is true that doing problems cam make some concepts easier to understand

# Real Life Design Patterns

When it comes to fashion, I follow a design pattern. The most noteable one that many people and myself use is wearing black pants and white shoes, or just the white shoes. This combination is one of the most tried and true combination in any outfit. Having black and white in the bottom layers of your color blocking allows for literally any color combination. The white sneakers are the most versatile color os sneakers you can wear, since it is very minimal and clean. From a casual outfit like a t-shirt and jeans, to semi-casual like chinos and a sports jacket. The strong foundation of white shoes and black pants serves as a solid foundation fo any outfit, in many occasions.

Thus, having the coding equivalent of white shoes and black pants is a very useful thing to have One of the design patterns that I have used is using the meteor-template from my ICS class. It serves as a really  good foundation for making a website since it uses Semantic UI in React, which is a very versatile and straight-forward framework for web development.

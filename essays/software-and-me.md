## What is Software Engineering?

Software Engineering is using the fundamentals of engineering to make code that instructs a computer to do a specific task. Whether it would be to detect if a door is open, to identifing what a banana is, software engineering is so broad that it can be used to solve virtually any problem. 

## I kind of like coding but not really.

When I was just starting college and took my first programming class, I developed a liking of making things with software. In that class, we a modified version of the game battleship. In our version, there are ships that were randomly placed in a 6 by 6 grid and the player had a limited amount of missles to sink all of the ships. It was then when I had a love for coding. The only thing that I did not like about doing that project was that 

## Skills That I want to develop

I want to develop more skills that relate to optimizing code and learning the time and space complexities. Other skills that I would improve is to be better at talking to people. That way, I can make more connects and  I find that in every code that is found in the Cracking the Code Interniew book. I also want to be competent enough so that I can be the lead designer of a big project.

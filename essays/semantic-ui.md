## If I described my first website like a drink, it would be water

This is my first time with learning HTML and using Semantic UI in the past three weeks. Prior to using Semantic UI, I learned HTML by doing several hours of tutorials. Making a website with just HTML ended with me making several different sizes of text with links to other html files. This also includes a lot of frustration and time from tweaking the elements so that they look organized inside of the screen. HTML requires eqch element to be sized according to the size of the screen, so if there is a change in the size of the screen, all of the elements of the website will become a jumbled mess. This is where Semantic Ui saves the day.

## Semantic UI is the Bread and Butter of Websites

This framework makes my life a lot easier. Using Semantic UI allows you to easily place elements in the right places. It automatically adjusts the elements so that it can be used in any sized screen. This way, the website can be seen on a mobile device or computer. The icing on the Semantic UI cake is that you will get what you want in one line of code. You want two centered rows? Then type "two centered rows". You want a menu? Type "menu". It is so simple to use.

## Why every software engineer should use UI frameworks

If multiple people were using a UI framework, then the code would be very easy to follow. The naming scheme of Semantic UI will allow any one that is working on the website to know where everything is. If the website just used HTML, the CSS file would be the only way to know where everything is. This also implies that everyone knows the naming scheme.

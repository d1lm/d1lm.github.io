## Let ESLint Debug the Code for You

Having a good coding standard will allow you to have a multiple programs that are consistant with one specific standard for coding. This way, all of the scripts that you write all follow the same nuances. After a week using IntelliJ and ESLint, I am a little frustrated with the constant errors that I need to fix, like not having spaces in certain parts of an array, or the bottom of the file having an extra line. Even though these small things do not affect the code in terms of usability, it is nice to have the consistancy of all of my code. This is the first time where I needed to follow a coding standard, and I don't really see the point of it. It did not help me learn to write in Javascript. However, it seems it is for organization for people that have pet peeves, and there are some cases where ESLint debugs the code for me.

## ESLint Encountered an Error but the Error is that You didn't put the Cereal before the Milk

My first impressions of ESLint is that it is like living with someone that has a lot of pet peeves but they actually go out of their way to tell you that something is wrong. It could be like your bag is slightly open, or they don't like the amount of tabs you have open in your browser, or they hate the fact that you own a pair of slippers that are too big for your feet. I understand that these things can tick someone off, but the function of the code is there, and that is all that matters to me. If ESLint was a person, they would be the friend with a overly clean house and their pantry is sorted in alphabetical order.

During this project, I worked with 2 other people to simulate a game of raqcuetball for one person. A typical game of raqcuetball requires one person to constantly hit a ball against a ball for as long as they can. For our purposes, the playing field is represented as 6 LEDs. The first LED acts as the area where the player is, to hit the ball back to the wall. The 6th LED is the wall. When the ball is hit, the location of the ball is the LED that is on. There is a switch on the circuit that acts as hitting the ball when the ball is in the strike zone. If you fail to hit the ball in the strike zone, you lose the game.

This project was great to for practicing to plan to solve a problem and collaborate with a team. We also used ASM charts, truth tables and verilog to implement the game. After planning all of this, we put all of the ideas on LogicWorks to make sure it worked and finally put it in a physical circuit board.
